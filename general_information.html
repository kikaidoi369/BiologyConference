                                    Thailand electrical voltage used is 220 volts.  Electrical appliances from countries using 110 volts will need a transformer for properly used; however, most computer adaptors can be plugged in directly (pending that the adaptor has an intake capacity of 220-240 volts). Outlet and plug designs that can be used in Thailand are shown in the pictures below.

                                    There are several ways to travel around Bangkok, depends on your preference of time management and fees that you want to spend.

                                    The two major public transportation systems in Bangkok metropolitan are the sky train (BTS <a href="http://www.bts.co.th/customer/en/02-route-current_new.aspx">http://www.bts.co.th/</a>) and the underground subway (MRT <a href="http://www.bangkokmetro.co.th/map.aspx?Lang=En&Menu=8">http://www.bangkokmetro.co.th/</a>). You can consult websites of both systems for their different stations and their adjacent tourist attractions.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Nearest to the convention venue is the Saladaeng station (BTS), and Samyan Station (MRT). For CU, the closest BTS stations are the National Stadium and Siam stations.

                                    Taxi is another convenient alternative to get around Bangkok.  Thai taxi price is relatively cheaper than in many other countries.  The fee starts from 35 Baht (around 1 USD) initially and then the meter rolls on.  However, being a visitor to Thailand might not provide you with the best benefit since many taxi drivers will take advantage of not using the meter but will charge you with a total price.  If this is the case, we recommend you not to use their service and flag down another taxi. Grab Taxi (<a href="https://www.grab.com/th/taxi/">https://www.grab.com/th/taxi/</a>) can be a suitable alternative.
                                </p>

                                    Motorcycle for hire is also another economic option to get to places in a speedy fashion, however, we advice against people who never been on a motorcycle before to use this service.  Many motorcyclists in Bangkok drive recklessly and dangerously.  You can easily identify where the motorcycle service stall will be by observing group of servicemen wearing bright orange jackets on many Bangkok footpaths.
                                </p>

                                    Buses and boats are available as well, though the systems are very confusing even for native residents. Only locals that travel frequent can explain to you about the route.

                                    Thailand uses a currency called Baht for its monetary exchange.  Money exchange can be made at most local Thai banks. The rate of different foreign currencies can be found in numerous banks websites, for example, <a href="https://www.kasikornbank.com/en/rate/Pages/Foreign-Exchange.aspx">https://www.kasikornbank.com/en/rate/Pages/Foreign-Exchange.aspx</a>.

                                    However, we suggest foreign visitors to use services from two local exchange companies: Siam Exchange (<a href="http://www.siamexchange.co.th">http://www.siamexchange.co.th</a>) and Super Rich (<a href="http://superrich.co.th">http://superrich.co.th</a>), which provide a slightly better rate, though the kiosks are not very common throughout Bangkok.

                                    Most if not all food and street vendors, taxi, and manual services in Thailand only accept cash.  Only major vendors in shopping malls accept credit card payments, including Visa, Master Card, and JCB.

                                    CU has an affiliation with Chulalongkorn Hospital (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Chulalongkorn_Memorial_Hospital">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Chulalongkorn_Memorial_Hospital</a>), which is monitored through Thai Red Cross.  For major accidents and long-term hospital stay the Chulalongkorn Hospital provides one of the best physician teams and health equipment, while the cost for going to private clinics in Bangkok is relatively affordable.  All foreign visitors are urge to purchase travel insurance before arriving to Thailand.
